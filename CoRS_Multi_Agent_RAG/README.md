# CoRS: Collaborative Retrieval and Synthesis

**A Novel Multi-Agent RAG Architecture for Intelligent Knowledge Sharing**

CoRS transforms traditional RAG from a solitary activity into a collaborative team sport, where agents share a dynamic workspace that acts as an intelligent cache between them and the knowledge base. This enables massive efficiency gains, emergent consensus, and superior synthesis quality through collective intelligence.

## 🎯 The Core Innovation

Traditional multi-agent RAG systems suffer from a fundamental inefficiency: **each agent acts independently**, leading to:
- ❌ Redundant expensive queries to the knowledge base
- ❌ No knowledge sharing between agents  
- ❌ Difficult final synthesis from disparate findings
- ❌ No collaborative validation or consensus

**CoRS solves this with a revolutionary approach:**

### The Shared Dynamic Context Workspace

Imagine a team of researchers working around a shared digital whiteboard. As they find information, they post it to the board, draw connections, and highlight key findings for others to see and use. CoRS digitalizes and automates this process.

## 🚀 How CoRS Works: The Three-Step Protocol

### Step 1: Consult the Workspace First
Before querying the expensive knowledge base, agents check the shared workspace:
```python
# Agent searches workspace first
workspace_results = workspace.search_workspace(query, top_k=5)
if workspace_results:
    return workspace_results  # 🎯 CACHE HIT!
```

### Step 2: Retrieve and Contribute  
If the workspace doesn't have the answer, query the main knowledge base and share findings:
```python
# Query main knowledge base
kb_chunks = vector_store.similarity_search(query, top_k=5)

# Contribute back to workspace with rich metadata
workspace.contribute_to_workspace(
    chunks=kb_chunks,
    agent_id="researcher_1", 
    query=query
)
```

### Step 3: Synthesize from Workspace
Final synthesis uses the most verified, collaborative information:
```python
# Get prioritized context (highly verified information)
synthesis_context = workspace.get_synthesis_context(
    task_description=topic,
    min_verification=2  # Require multiple agent verification
)
```

## 📊 Massive Efficiency Gains

## 🧠 Rich Metadata System

Each piece of information in the workspace includes:

```python
@dataclass
class ChunkMetadata:
    chunk_id: str
    content: str
    saliency_score: float      # Relevance to original query (0.0-1.0)
    verification_count: int    # How many agents found this independently
    retrieval_sources: List    # Who found it and why
    synthesis_status: bool     # Has this been used in synthesis?
    timestamp: float          # Last access time
    ttl_expires: float        # When this expires
```

This metadata enables:
- **🎯 Intelligent ranking** by verification count and relevance
- **🔍 Provenance tracking** - know who found what and why
- **⚡ Automatic cleanup** through TTL expiration
- **🤝 Collaboration metrics** and quality assessment
