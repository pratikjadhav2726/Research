# 🧠 Research Prototypes & Knowledge Graphs

Welcome to the **Research & Prototype Repository** by [@pratikjadhav2726](https://github.com/pratikjadhav2726) — a curated and expanding archive of experimental ideas, novel ML techniques, and prototypes.

This repository serves as a **launchpad for fresh research directions** and **modular prototypes** that you can fork, remix, and scale. Each folder represents a unique thread of innovation across multiple domains, from RAG to graph ML and more.
