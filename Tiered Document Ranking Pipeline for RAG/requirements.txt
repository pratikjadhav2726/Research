# Python package dependencies for the Tiered Document Ranking Pipeline

# Core pipeline components
pyserini>=0.16.0 # Check for a recent stable version
sentence-transformers>=2.2.0 # For CrossEncoder models
openai>=1.0.0,<2.0.0 # For LLM interaction (using v1.x.x of openai lib)
datasets>=2.0.0 # For loading datasets like MSMARCO

# Dependencies often required by the above libraries
torch>=1.8.0 # Backend for sentence-transformers and other ML tasks
transformers>=4.10.0 # Often used by sentence-transformers and Pyserini indirectly

# For running the pipeline and examples
tqdm>=4.60.0 # For progress bars

# Note: faiss-cpu was mentioned but its direct usage in the current Python script
# is not apparent. If it's a transitive dependency or needed for specific Pyserini
# dense index types (not used in the current BM25-focused script), it could be added.
# For now, keeping it out unless a direct need is confirmed.
# faiss-cpu

# For development and testing (install separately or via a dev-requirements.txt)
# pytest
# pytest-mock
